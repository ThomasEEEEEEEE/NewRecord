# NewRecord
NewRecord! is an android application designed to help people keep track of their personal records in their favorite sports and activities. Just enter the name of your record and your best score, and you'll be able to keep track of your history with this activity and view it in a list or chart form. The app also contains a social section where you can add your friends and challenge each other to see who can improve at an activity faster.

NewRecord! was made using Xamarin Forms and utilizes a Microsoft Azure database.
